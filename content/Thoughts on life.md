Promise to God: I'll practice noFap in return for achieving my goals

I do this because there's no great war or great revolution for me to fight right now. Becoming a great software engineer will let me be financially self sufficient. It will open entrepreneurial doors that currently remain shut for me. It will allow me to make a difference and contribute significantly to the problems of the world that i come across. I will become capable of making great change.

## What happens if you keep heading the way you are right now?

## Who do you want to be?
I want to be fierencely independent individual. Someone who's disciplined and has integrity. Extremely driven entreprenur who's always looking to do exciting new things. 

## Create a system and follow it to the T.

## On Entrepreurship

Find a way to create value for people. Real value. Not some gimmick. Take up a decently big problem.
How to find a problem?
There have always been problems in the world that are waiting to be solved. The problem at time is that we accept those problems as a reality. This acceptance makes us blind to the capability of even being able to see those things as a problem. You must take those glasses off and look at everything from a fresh perspective, like you were born everyday. Question everything like you used to.
