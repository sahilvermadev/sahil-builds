## Blockchain's impact
On the internet cryptography was traditionally responsible for secure communication via [[key exchange]] and encryption.

However the most recent applications have been in the blockchain space where it is being used for 2 use cases:
1. Data Integrity - [[signatures]], [[commitments]], [[ZK proofs]]
2. Protecting secret keys via threshold signatures.

Similarly there are many other sciences that have also been advanced with the coming of blockchains [Conference](https://www.sbc-conference.com/2025/):
1. New [Consenus Protocol](consensusLayer.md) (distributed systems)
2. New Cryptography ([ZK-SNARKs](ZK-SNARKs))
3. New Enconomic Models (tokenomics, lending protocols, exchanges)
4. New Democractic Governance Mechanisms ([DAOs](DAOs.md))
5. New progrogramming languages and verification tools


## What is blockchain used for?
A blockchain provides a method to coordinate among many parties where there is no single trusted party. *An important contrapostive - If there is a trusted party then blockchain is generally not required.*

## Current application areas
1. Finance ([DeFi](DeFi)) - new financial instruments, exchanges, lending...
2. Managing digital assets (NFTs) - Assured provenance
3. DAOs

## What are the new innovations that blockchain brought to the world?
1. 2009 - Bitcoin gave us the Ledger - a public append only data structure.
2. 2015 - Ethereum gave us the blockchain computer that allowed people to write [composable programs](UNIX.md) on the blockchain.  
3. 2017 -> Current Day - a number of application areas have come up.

## What is a blockchain
A blockchain is composed of 4 different layers:
1. [Consensus Layer](consensusLayer.md) (data availability)
2. [Execution Layer](ethereum.md) (blockchain computer)
3. Application Layer (DAPPs, smart contracts)
4. User facing tools (wallets, cloud servers)

# Hot research topics
1. Scaling problem - Ethereum processes 15tps. How to increase?
2. Privacy on the blockchain - businesses cant use if all transactions are problem
3. Interoperability between blockchains
4. Managing Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)
5. Zero knowledge proofs of solvency. (the FTX case)
