A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block is a list of transactions + the hash of the previous block.

It is important that a blockchain has these properties:
1. **Safety**: All honest participants have the same data or that everybody agrees on the history of the blockchain.
	2. Persistance/Immutability: Data once added can never be removed.
2. **Liveness** - Participants can add new transactions
	1. Censorship: anyone can add data

## How is the blockchain built?
1. A proposer is elected to announce a new block.
	1. There are 2 mechnaisms for doing a proposer election:
		1. [Proof of Work](proofOfWork.md)
		2. [Proof of Stake](proofOfStake.md)
 
2. Everyone decides whether to accept this block or to ignore.
		In proof of work 2 is achieved by using the longest chain algorithm.
		In proof of stake we have two options for achieving the 2nd requirement:
			1. [Longest Chain](longestChain)
			2. [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](byzantineFaultTolerance) (Byzantine fault tolerance became on option because in Proof of stake there are a fixed number of validators)


### Desired consensus properties:

- **Safety**: Validators agree on history.
- **Liveness**: Every valid transaction eventually gets added.
- **Resilience against 1/3 Byzantine validators**.
- **Partially-synchronous**: There exists an unknown bound Î” on network delay with a shared global clock.
